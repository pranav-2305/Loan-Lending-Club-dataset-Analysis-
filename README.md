Section 1: Getting Started with Data
•	Load a dataset and explore its structure.
•	Understand memory usage and data types.
•	Learn how to handle large datasets efficiently.

Section 2: Data Cleaning and Transformation
1.	Identify and handle missing values using different techniques such as:
o	Removing rows or columns with excessive missing values.
o	Filling missing values using mean, median, mode, or interpolation.
o	Using forward-fill and backward-fill methods for time-series data.
3.	Normalize and standardize numerical data to improve consistency and comparability using:
o	Min-Max scaling.
o	Z-score normalization.
o	Log transformations for skewed data.
4.	Work with date-time data by:
o	Converting strings to datetime format.
o	Extracting useful components like year, month, day, hour, and weekday.
o	Calculating time differences and aggregating time-based data

Section 3: Advanced Data Aggregation and Grouping
•	Perform multi-level grouping using groupby() and aggregate multiple metrics simultaneously for in-depth analysis.
•	Implement custom aggregation functions with apply() to calculate specialized statistics beyond standard aggregation.
•	Use pivot tables to reshape and analyze data from different perspectives, and leverage crosstabs to summarize categorical relationships

Section 4: Combining and Reshaping Data
•	Merge different datasets using join operations.
•	Transform data using melt() and pivot().
•	Rearrange data using stack and unstack functions.

Section 5: Time Series Basics
•	Resample time-series data to different time intervals.
•	Calculate rolling averages and trends.
•	Use smoothing techniques to analyze patterns.

Section 6: Practical Case Study
•	Choose a real-world dataset (e.g., sales, weather, or social media data).
•	Perform a step-by-step analysis, including:
o	Data cleaning
o	Exploratory data analysis
o	Key insights and recommendations
